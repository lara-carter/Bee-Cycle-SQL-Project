## Context
Bee Cycle is a fictitious cycling company that opened in July 2017 and sells a range of cycling products in stores across the globe. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Bee Cycle has started to suffer a decline in profits.

## Objective

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Which products are most profitable?
2. Which months are most profitable?
3. Which regions are most profitable?
4. What type of customer generates the most profit?
5. Which customers spend the most money?
6. Which cities are most profitable, what are the most popular products within these cities and in what colours?

## Data Used
5 datasets were used for this analysis. All data is fictitious and was retrieved from [this public repository](https://github.com/yodialfa/bigQuery-BeeCycle).
